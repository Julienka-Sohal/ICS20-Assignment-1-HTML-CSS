      <h2 class="divheader">Early Life</h2>
      <p>
        Margaret Elaine Heafield was born August 17, 1936, in Paoli, Indiana.
        Later the family moved to Michigan, where Margaret graduated from
        Hancock High School in 1954. She studied mathematics at the University
        of Michigan in 1955 before transferring to Earlham College, from where
        she earned a BA (Bachelors of arts) in mathematics with a minor in
        philosophy in 1958.
      </p>
      <h3 class="divheader">Career</h3>
      <p>
        In Boston, Hamilton was going to enroll in graduate study in abstract
        mathematics at Brandeis but, in mid-1959, she began working for Edward
        Norton Lorenz, in the meteorology department at MIT. She developed
        software for predicting weather, programming on the LGP-30 and the PDP-1
        computers at Marvin Minsky's Project MAC. Her work contributed to
        Lorenz's publications on chaos theory. At the time, computer science and
        software engineering were not yet established disciplines; instead,
        programmers learned on the job with hands-on experience. She moved on to
        another project in the summer of 1961, and hired and trained Ellen
        Fetter as her replacement.
      </p>
      <h4 class="divheader">SAGE Project</h4>
      <p>
        From 1961 to 1963, Hamilton worked on the Semi-Automatic Ground
        Environment (SAGE) Project at the MIT Lincoln Lab, where she was one of
        the programmers who wrote software for the prototype AN/FSQ-7 computer,
        used by the U.S. Air Force to search for possibly unfriendly aircraft.
        She also wrote software for a satellite tracking project at the Air
        Force Cambridge Research Laboratories. The SAGE Project was an extension
        of Project Whirlwind, started by MIT to create a computer system that
        could predict weather systems and track their movements using
        simulators. SAGE was soon developed for military use in anti-aircraft
        air defense. Hamilton said:
        <br />
        <br />
        “What they used to do when you came into this organization as a
        beginner, was to assign you this program which nobody was able to ever
        figure out or get to run. When I was a beginner they gave it to me as
        well. And what had happened was it was tricky programming, and the
        person who wrote it took delight in the fact that all of his comments
        were in Greek and Latin. So I was assigned this program and I actually
        got it to work. It even printed out its answers in Latin and Greek. I
        was the first one to get it to work.”
        <br />
        <br />
        It was her efforts on this project that made her a candidate for the
        position at NASA as the lead developer for Apollo flight software.
      </p>
      <h5 class="divheader">Draper Laboratory</h5>
      <p>
        Hamilton then joined the Charles Stark Draper Laboratory at MIT, which
        worked on the Apollo Space Mission. First Hamilton was hired as a
        programmer for this process but moved on into system designs. By 1965,
        she was in charge of all Command Module software, which was all the
        software for navigation and lunar landing guidance. Hamilton's team was
        responsible for developing in-flight software, which included algorithms
        designed by various senior scientists for the Apollo command module,
        Apollo lunar module, and the subsequent Skylab.
        <br />
        <br />
        Another part of her team designed and developed the systems software.
        This included error detection and recovery software such as restarts and
        the Display Interface Routines (also known as the Priority Displays),
        which Hamilton designed and developed.She worked to gain hands-on
        experience during a time when computer science courses were uncommon and
        software engineering courses did not exist.Hamilton also served as
        Director of the Software Engineering Division.
      </p>
      <h6 class="divheader">Apllo Program</h6>
      <p>
        In one of the critical moments of the Apollo 11 mission, the Apollo
        Guidance Computer, together with the on-board flight software, averted
        an abort of the landing on the Moon. Three minutes before the lunar
        lander reached the Moon's surface, several computer alarms were
        triggered. The on-board flight software captured these alarms with the
        "never supposed to happen displays" interrupting the astronauts with
        priority alarm displays. Hamilton had prepared for just this situation
        years before:
        <br />
        <br />
        There was one other failsafe that Hamilton likes to remember. Her
        "priority display" innovation had created a knock-on risk that
        astronauts and computers would slip out of sync just when it mattered
        most. As the alarms went off and priority displays replaced normal ones,
        the actual switchover to new programmes behind the screens was happening
        "a step slower" than it would today.
        <br />
        <br />
        Hamilton had thought hard about this. After a long pause she figured it
        out.
        <br />
        <br />
        By some accounts, the astronauts had inadvertently left the rendezvous
        radar switch on, causing these alarms to be triggered (the claim that
        the radar was left on inadvertently by the astronauts is disputed by
        Robert Wills with the National Museum of Computing). The computer was
        overloaded with interrupts caused by incorrectly phased power supplied
        to the lander's rendezvous radar.The program alarms indicated "executive
        overflows", meaning the guidance computer could not complete all of its
        tasks in real time and had to postpone some of them. The asynchronous
        executive designed by J. Halcombe Laning was used by Hamilton's team to
        develop asynchronous flight software:
        <br />
        <br />
        Because of the flight software's system-software's error detection and
        recovery techniques that included its system-wide "kill and recompute"
        from a "safe place" restart approach to its snapshot and rollback
        techniques, the Display Interface Routines ( the priority displays)
        together with its man-in-the-loop capabilities were able to be created
        in order to have the capability to interrupt the astronauts' normal
        mission displays with priority displays of critical alarms in case of an
        emergency. This depended on our assigning a unique priority to every
        process in the software in order to ensure that all of its events would
        take place in the correct order and at the right time relative to
        everything else that was going on.
        <br />
        <br />
        Hamilton's priority alarm displays interrupted the astronauts' normal
        displays to warn them that there was an emergency "giving the astronauts
        a go/no go decision (to land or not to land)". Jack Garman, a NASA
        computer engineer in mission control, recognized the meaning of the
        errors that were presented to the astronauts by the priority displays
        and shouted, "Go, go!" and they continued. Paul Curto, senior
        technologist who nominated Hamilton for a NASA Space Act Award, called
        Hamilton's work "the foundation for ultra-reliable software design".
        Hamilton later wrote of the incident:
        <br />
        <br />
        “The computer (or rather the software in it) was smart enough to
        recognize that it was being asked to perform more tasks than it should
        be performing. It then sent out an alarm, which meant to the astronaut,
        'I'm overloaded with more tasks than I should be doing at this time and
        I'm going to keep only the more important tasks'; i.e., the ones needed
        for landing ... Actually, the computer was programmed to do more than
        recognize error conditions. A complete set of recovery programs was
        incorporated into the software. The software's action, in this case, was
        to eliminate lower priority tasks and re-establish the more important
        ones… If the computer hadn't recognized this problem and taken recovery
        action, I doubt if Apollo 11 would have been the successful moon landing
        it was.”

        — Letter from Margaret H. Hamilton, Director of Apollo Flight Computer
        Programming MIT Draper Laboratory, Cambridge, Massachusetts, titled
        "Computer Got Loaded", published in Datamation, March 1, 1971

      <p>
        In 1976, Hamilton co-founded with Saydean Zeldin a company called Higher
        Order Software ot in other words HOS to further develop ideas about
        error prevention and fault tolerance emerging from their experience at
        MIT working on the Apollo program. They created a product called USE.IT,
        based on the HOS methodology they developed at MIT. It was successfully
        used in numerous government programs including a project to formalize
        and implement C-IDEF, an automated version of IDEF, a modeling language
        developed by the U.S. Air Force in the Integrated Computer-Aided
        Manufacturing (ICAM) project.
        <br />
        <br />
        Hamilton was the CEO of HOS through 1984 and left the company in 1985.
        In March 1986, she founded Hamilton Technologies, Inc. in Cambridge,
        Massachusetts. The company was developed around the Universal Systems
        Language (USL) and its associated automated environment, the 001 Tool
        Suite, based on her paradigm of development before the fact for systems
        design and software development.
